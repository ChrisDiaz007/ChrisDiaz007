![css3-plain-wordmark](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2845d9e-c421-431f-b2e8-35399258352b)## Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Christopher Diaz

<p align="justify">
Driven by curiosity, I enjoy combining creativity with logic to solve problems. After working for 2.5 years as an IT support specialist, I developed strong teamwork skills and became both user and results oriented. My experience in IT sparked my passion for coding. I recently completed Le Wagon's intensive web development Tokyo bootcamp, learning skills in Ruby and JavaScript, and I'm now seeking a full stack development role.
